## 🌍 The Problem

In India’s local **mandis and open markets**, pricing is still driven by:
- Word of mouth
- Middlemen influence
- Asymmetric information
- Language & literacy barriers

📉 **Result?**
- Sellers underprice
- Buyers overpay
- Negotiations lack **proof**
- Trust is missing

Most existing apps only **show prices** —  
they don’t help users **prove**, **justify**, or **negotiate** with confidence.

---

## 💡 The Core Idea

> **What if price negotiation came with proof?**

**Vyapar AI** transforms raw market data into  
**verified, explainable, and negotiable price intelligence** —  
accessible via **voice**, **local language**, and **mobile-first UX**.

---

## 🚀 What Vyapar AI Does

✅ Fetches real-time (or near real-time) market prices  
✅ Validates prices using official & trusted sources  
✅ Explains *why* a price is fair  
✅ Generates **Fair Price Certificates (FPC)**  
✅ Works offline-first as a **PWA**  
✅ Designed for **non-MRP**, real-world trade

---

## ⭐ The ONE Novel Innovation (USP)

### 🧾 **Fair Price Certificate (FPC)**

A **QR-verifiable proof of price fairness** that can be shown during negotiation.

Each certificate includes:
- 📦 Product
- 📍 Nearest mandi (via location)
- 💰 Verified price range
- 🏛 Source (Govt / Market data)
- ⏱ Timestamp & expiry

> **No more “AI told me” — now it’s “Here’s the proof.”**

---

## 🎤 Voice-First, India-First

Vyapar AI is built for **real Indian markets**, not spreadsheets.

- 🎙 Voice queries (Hindi / English / Regional)
- 🗺 Location-based mandi detection (Map-based)
- 📱 One-handed mobile UX
- 🔊 Spoken explanations for insights

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture (High Level)

```

User (Voice / Text)
↓
React PWA (Offline Cache)
↓
FastAPI / Node.js Backend
↓
LangChain Agent (Non-Hallucinating)
↓
Verified Data Sources / Mock APIs
↓
Supabase (Auth + DB)

```

🧠 **Key principle:**  
> LLMs format & explain — they do NOT invent data.

---

## 🧪 Mock Data Strategy (Development Friendly)

Since many real APIs are restricted:
- 📦 Realistic mock datasets
- 🔁 Swappable data adapters
- 🧪 Same logic → real APIs later

This keeps the system:
- Testable
- Scalable
- Hackathon & production ready

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|----|----|
| Frontend | React + PWA |
| Backend | FastAPI / Node.js |
| AI Orchestration | LangChain |
| Database | Supabase |
| Auth | Supabase Auth |
| Maps | Browser Geolocation + Map SDK |
| Voice | ASR + TTS (pluggable) |

---

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 User Roles

- 🧑‍🌾 Sellers / Farmers
- 🧑‍💼 Traders
- 🧑‍🛒 Buyers (QR Scan Only)
- 🛠 Admin (Analytics)

Each role has **distinct workflows & UI**, not generic dashboards.

---

## 💰 Business Value

Users don’t pay for data —  
they pay for **confidence**, **trust**, and **better negotiation outcomes**.

### Possible Monetization:
- Free → View prices
- Paid → Certificates, trends, insights
- B2B → Market analytics
- Govt / NGO → Transparency layer

---

## 🛣 Roadmap

- 🔮 Demand forecasting
- 📊 Market trend analytics
- 🧠 Smart negotiation suggestions
- 🌐 More regional languages
- 🧾 Digital trade records

---

## 🏁 Vision

> **Vyapar AI is not a marketplace.**  
> It’s an **intelligence layer** for India’s real markets.

Turning:
- Prices → Proof  
- Data → Trust  
- AI → Empowerment
